                React Native is an open source framework for building 
                Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform's 
                native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to 
                access your platform's APIs as well as to describe the appearance 
                and behavior of your UI using React components:<span class="italic">bundles of reusable, nestable code</span>. 
                You can learn more about React in the next section. 
                But first, let's cover how components work in React Native.

                React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular 
                open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. 
                To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. 
                This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

            <p class="section_text" id="first">
                We're going to cover the core concepts behind React:
            </p>

            <p class="section_text" id="second">
                <span class="bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to 
                React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that 
                need names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>

            <p class="section_text" id="third">
                <span class="bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, 
                a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:  
                <span class="background">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.
            </p>

            <p class="section_text">
                The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> 
                you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use 
                variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="background">name</span> 
                for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside 
                <span class="background">&lt;Text&gt;</span>
            </p>

            <p class="section_text">
                <span class="bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
            </p>

            <p class="section_text" id="fourth">
                <span class="bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as 
                arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like 
                a component's personal data storage. State is useful for handling 
                data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. 
                State gives your components memory!

                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It 
                has an <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function 
                to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop 
                that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>

            <p class="section_text" id="fifth">
                For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their 
                words into a different language. In this new language, every single 
                word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" 
                would be translated as "üçï üçï".
